# OneTab Reborn
OneTab Reborn is a remake of the original OneTab extension to be more modern, responsive, and brings native dark mode support.

## Info
**Latest Version: 0.2 BETA**

**Development Status: Active!**

## Compatability
- OneTab Reborn is completely compatible with OneTab URLs so you can easily move your existing URLs to OneTab Reborn through the Import/Export section.
- OneTab Reborn can work alongside OneTab although it is recommended to uninstall OneTab when you have finished setting up OneTab Reborn.

## How to install OneTab Reborn
1. Head to the Releases page [here](https://github.com/Nuzza/OneTab-Reborn/releases) and download the latest version available.
2. Once downloaded extract 'OneTab-Reborn-main.zip' to a directory where it most likely won't be moved or accidently deleted.
3. Open Google Chrome/Microsoft Edge and go to 'chrome://extensions/' for Google Chrome or 'edge://extensions/' for Microsoft Edge
4. Enable 'Developer mode' if not already enabled
5. Select 'Load unpacked' and navigate to the directory where your extracted 'OneTab-Reborn-main' folder is.
6. Open the folder and its sub folders until you see the following folders:
- _locales
- fonts
- images
7. Click 'Select Folder' and OneTab Reborn should be successfully installed.
8. If you can't see OneTab Reborn in the extensions toolbar, make sure it isn't hidden in the menu.

## How to update OneTab Reborn
1. Make sure you backup/export your current OneTab Reborn tabs as updating will reset OneTab Reborn.
2. Uninstall OneTab Reborn (this is just a precaution as not doing so might cause multiple versions of OneTab Reborn to be installed and conflict with one another)
3. Follow the same steps under 'How to install OneTab Reborn'
